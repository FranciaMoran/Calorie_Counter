# Calorie Counter
The Calorie Counter is a full stack app which provides the user the ability to keep track of the total intakes of various nutritional areas including but not limited to calories, cholesterol and dietary fiber. This is accomplished with use of the Nutritionix api which allows users to find nutritional information on a wide range of food items. Users also have the option of editing information found from the Nutritionix api and creating their own custom item to be added to their logged food items.

The functionality of the Calorie Counter app is accomplished with use of: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB and Node.js.
